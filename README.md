# This is a project displaying the basic functions of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).


# PROGRAMS/EXTENSIONS NEEDED TO RUN PROJECT:

-MAMP
-PHP 7.3.8
-APACHE
-DOCKER
-SQLPRO OR ANY COMPATIBLE ALTERNATIVE

-MAMP will be used to host our database and the connection will be placed in the "db_connection.php" file within the "includes" folder.

-A majority of the code will be written using PHP, so PHP >v7.3.8 will need to be installed.

-You will need access to the database. I reccommend using SQLPRO, but anything comparable will also do.

# Bootstrap 4 was also used for the modals and table.

The site itself is very simple... Simply type "localhost" into your address bar, and click on "crudproject" within the index. From there, the data will be displayed into a table, with an edit and delete button. You may also add your own data by clikcing the "Add Artist" button. If you refresh the table within the database, you'll notice that the data will be edited, deleted, or added depending on what you've done.
